# Songlify

Welcome to Songlify, an interactive web-game that challenges you to guess your favorite songs from any Spotify Playlist! Dive into a world of music, exploring genres or personal playlists, and test how well you know your tunes. Whether you're a pop fanatic or a classical connoisseur, Songlify offers an engaging and fun way to connect with music.

## How to Play

### Searching for Playlists
- **Genre/Keyword Search**: Type in your preferred genre or keywords into the search bar. Songlify will fetch a variety of playlists based on your query.
- **Direct Playlist Play**: Have a specific Spotify playlist in mind? Simply copy and paste the playlist link into Songlify to start your musical guessing game.

### Gameplay
1. **Choose a Playlist**: Select from the search results or enter a playlist link.
2. **Play a Random Song**: A random song from the chosen playlist will be selected. Hit the play button to listen to a snippet.
3. **Make Your Guess**: Think you know the song? Enter your guess for the song name.
4. **Limited Chances**: You have 6 attempts to guess the song correctly. Can you ace it in fewer tries?

## Planned To-Do's
- [ ] **Modularize**: Some files are HUGE. Separate code into more functions.
- [ ] **Expand Playlist Results**: Increase the number of playlist results beyond the current cap of 50 for a wider selection.
- [ ] **User Score System**: Implement a personal scoring system to track user performance over time.
- [ ] **Enhanced Aesthetics**: Make the website look prettier, it's ugly ㅠㅠ.
